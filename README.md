This is a humanitarian application whose primary usage is to connect customers and humanitarian organisations. Our application starts at PoS device, after completing the payment transaction. 

At the beginning, customer is asked whether they like to donate money for charity or not. There are suggested charities, as well as an option to choose from the drop down menu, where all charities from the database are listed.

If they opt for "No(NE)" their shopping is over. 
On the other hand, if they proceed with donation they have an option to choose between suggested amounts or to type their own. 

After pressing "Pay(Plati)" button they can pay. PoS device will immediately print desgined receipt with QR code that leads to website page of charity that money is donated to. In this way customers are able to track work of that charity and impact that their donation has.
